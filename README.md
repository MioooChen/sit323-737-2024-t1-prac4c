This code is a simple arithmetic operation service written in Node.js and Express framework. It provides several HTTP POST endpoints that allow users to perform basic and advanced arithmetic operations. Here is a brief description of what each endpoint does:

/add: Addition endpoint, takes two numbers (num1 and num2) as input and returns the sum of these two numbers.

/subtract: Subtraction endpoint, takes two numbers (num1 and num2) as input and returns their difference.

/multiply: Multiplication endpoint, takes two numbers (num1 and num2) as input and returns their product.

/divide: Division endpoint, takes two numbers (num1 and num2) as input and returns their quotient. If num2 is 0, the error message "Cannot divide by zero" is returned.

/power: Exponential endpoint, receives two numbers (num1 and num2) as input, and returns num1 raised to the num2 power.

/sqrt: Square root endpoint, receives a number (num) as input and returns its square root. If the input is a negative number, the error message "Cannot compute square root of negative number" is returned.

The service uses JSON format to receive input and return output. Each endpoint has input validation to ensure the correct type of data is received and returns a meaningful error message if the data is invalid.

Finally, the service is started on the port specified by the environment variable. If no port is specified, port 3000 is used by default. When the server starts, a message appears on the console indicating that the service is running and the port number it is running on.
